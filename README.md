# line-collection
Tool for arranging and watching various shapes made our of lines alone.

At the main menu you can decide between three different shapes: 

*triangle, 
*circle, or 
*square. 

With any of these three shapes, you can then choose to either arrange them, or watch a pre-made animation. If a user wishes to arrange, they can either use the mouse wheel or the up/down keys to change the size of the shape. Then, they can click anywhere within the program's canvas to place a shape. If a user chooses watch instead, they can sit back and enjoy the show. At anytime, a user can press the exit button at the bottom-right to return to the main menu.
