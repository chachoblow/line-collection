# line-collection
Tool for arranging and watching various shapes made our of lines alone. If you wish to try it out, visit [this link](https://editor.p5js.org/chachoblow/full/H1Cb47__Q). Although it is intuitive to use, instructions can be found below.

At the main menu you can decide between three different shapes: 

* triangle 
* circle 
* square 

With any of these three shapes, you can then choose to either arrange them, or watch a pre-made animation. Below is an image of the main menu. In the second image, the user is hovering over the circle shape.

If a user wishes to arrange, they can either use the mouse wheel or the up/down keys to change the size of the shape. Then, they can click anywhere within the program's canvas to place a shape. Below is an image of this being done with the circle shape.

If a user chooses to watch instead, they can sit back and enjoy the show! This can be seen with the triangle shape below.
